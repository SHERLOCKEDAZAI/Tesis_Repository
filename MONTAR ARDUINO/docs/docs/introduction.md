# Introduction

The OneWireHub is a sleek Arduino compatible (and many more platforms) library to emulate OneWire-Periphery with support for various devices & sensors. The motivation is to offer a shared code base for all OneWire-Periphery-Devices. With a small overhead one ÂµC can emulate up to 32 ICs simultaneously.
The main goal is to use modern sensors (mainly [I2C](https://github.com/orgua/iLib) or SPI interface) and transfer their measurements into one or more emulated ds2438 which have 4x16bit registers for values. This feature removes the limitations of modern house-automation-systems. Add humidity, light and other sensors easy to your home automation environment.
